    "user_explanation": "Observe, the given inputs first of all see that all matrix dimensions between input and outputs remain the same. Like if its 10x10 it remains 10x10 in output and if its 11x11 then its still 11x11 in output. Now, lets observe patterns, see patterns remain static orange boxes exist both in input and output. They remain as is, including retaining border color. They can be identified pretty easily  by figuring out where orange bordered boxes exist in input, now inside each orange border box, there's an internal square. If the dimension of the internal square. So like if it's odd in dimension then fill with gray else even then fill it in with green. These colored in-fillings are the primary difference between input and output",

All input and output pairs are of the same dimension for each example.\\\\\\\\n- Three key colors exist: background (blue, 0), orange (1), green (2), and gray (7) in outputs.\\\\\\\\n- The orange color in both input and output forms contiguous closed loop shapes\\\\u2014always forming the border of a square or rectangular region. These orange regions form box-like shapes (some are nested, some are non-overlapping/disjoint).\\\\\\\\n- The center (interior) of each orange-bordered square/rectangle is filled with background color in the input, but in the output is filled with an internal solid color (either green or gray).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCorrespondence between input and output:\\\\\\\\n- The positions and shapes of the orange-bordered boxes are identical between input and output\\\\u2014there is no translation, rotation, or resizing. The background stays the same outside the structures.\\\\\\\\n- The ONLY difference between input and output occurs inside the internal regions surrounded by orange borders. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n  * If the orange shape forms a perfect square (all sides equal), the area inside the border is also a square. This interior region is filled with either green (2) or gray (7) in the output.\\\\\\\\n  * Whether green or gray is chosen is based on the interior square's dimension: green for even-size interiors, gray for odds.\\\\\\\\n- No other aspect of the images is changed. No new or changed orange, no altered blue, no shapes added or removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPatterns and structures:\\\\\\\\n- The orange boxes never overlap and never touch except possibly at a corner; each simply frames an open space in the input, and that space is either empty or filled in the output.\\\\\\\\n- The frequency and placement of the filled interiors correspond exactly to the orange-bordered shapes. Each box yields one interior region to fill.\\\\\\\\n- The orange border is always one pixel/row/column thick.\\\\\\\\n- Sometimes, a box is embedded within another's background zone, but no two interiors overlap.\\\\\\\\n- Edge cases: some orange boxes are right against the edges, but their fill-in rules remain unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNumerical properties:\\\\\\\\n- The size (width/height) of each orange-bordered region's interior determines its output fill color (even=green, odd=gray), so counting or measuring the box is required for the solution.\\\\\\\\n- Number of regions per image varies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetry and spatial relationships:\\\\\\\\n- No explicit global symmetry, but all orange-bordered shapes are axis-aligned squares.\\\\\\\\n- No need to reflect, rotate, or translate anything\\\\u2014just segmentation and checking interior size.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the main transformation is identifying each orange-bordered square, determining its interior size, and filling the interior with the correct color based on parity, while all else remains the same.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStepwise Expanded Solution Reasoning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Identify orange-bordered square regions in the input**\\\\\\\\n   - Find all contiguous regions of color 1 (orange).\\\\\\\\n   - For each region, check if it forms a closed, axis-aligned square border (width = height, all border pixels are orange, interior is blue in input).\\\\\\\\n   - For each such region, determine the coordinates (top, left, bottom, right) of the bounding square.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Determine interior fill candidate for each square**\\\\\\\\n   - For each orange-bordered square, examine the region one step in from all four sides: the interior square.\\\\\\\\n   - Measure the dimension d of this interior (it is always (side - 2) for a border of thickness 1).\\\\\\\\n   - If d is odd, the fill color is gray (7). If d is even, the fill color is green (2).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Create the output matrix**\\\\\\\\n   - Start with a copy of the input matrix to preserve oranges and backgrounds.\\\\\\\\n   - For each identified orange-bordered square, fill the interior (determined by step 2) with the selected color (2 or 7) in the output matrix.\\\\\\\\n   - All other elements remain unchanged. Output will thus exactly match the input except for the colored interiors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Edge Cases**\\\\\\\\n   - Boxes touching/in contact with the grid's border\\\\u2014ensure the interior calculations handle index bounds.\\\\\\\\n   - Overlapping boxes (not observed in examples) are not a factor but would require care in fill sequence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudocode for implementation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef fill_boxes(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    output = input_mat.copy()\\\\\\\\n    h, w = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    visited = np.zeros_like(input_mat, dtype=bool)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    for i in range(h):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(w):\\\\\\\\n            if input_mat[i,j] == 1 and not visited[i,j]:\\\\\\\\n                # Try to find the bounds of this orange-bordered box\\\\\\\\n                # Expand right and down to find the edge of the box\\\\\\\\n                right = j\\\\\\\\n                while right+1 < w and input_mat[i,right+1]==1:\\\\\\\\n                    right += 1\\\\\\\\n                bottom = i\\\\\\\\n                while bottom+1 < h and input_mat[bottom+1,j]==1:\\\\\\\\n                    bottom += 1\\\\\\\\n                # Now, verify that top, bottom, left, right forms a closed border:\\\\\\\\n                if right-j >= 2 and bottom-i >= 2:\\\\\\\\n                    is_valid = True\\\\\\\\n                    # top and bottom row\\\\\\\\n                    if not np.all(input_mat[i,j:right+1]==1): is_valid = False\\\\\\\\n                    if not np.all(input_mat[bottom,j:right+1]==1): is_valid = False\\\\\\\\n                    # left and right column\\\\\\\\n                    if not np.all(input_mat[i:bottom+1,j]==1): is_valid = False\\\\\\\\n                    if not np.all(input_mat[i:bottom+1,right]==1): is_valid = False\\\\\\\\n                    if is_valid:\\\\\\\\n                        # Mark all of this box as visited so we don't process twice\\\\\\\\n                        visited[i:bottom+1,j:right+1]=True\\\\\\\\n                        # Interior coordinates:\\\\\\\\n                        if right-j > 1 and bottom-i > 1:\\\\\\\\n                            for row in range(i+1, bottom):\\\\\\\\n                                for col in range(j+1, right):\\\\\\\\n                                    # Fill with 2 (green) if even interior, 7 (gray) if odd\\\\\\\\n                                    interior_dim = right-j-1 # or bottom-i-1, square\\\\\\\\n                                    fill_val = 2 if interior_dim%2==0 else 7\\\\\\\\n                                    output[row,col]=fill_val\\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting against all examples:\\\\\\\\n- In each example, this algorithm would:\\\\\\\\n   * Detect all orange-bordered boxes (including those touching or near edges)\\\\\\\\n   * Correctly classify and fill interiors as either green or gray by checking odd/even (for example, 3x3 interior becomes gray, 4x4 interior becomes green, etc)\\\\\\\\n   * Leave all exterior regions and orange borders whole and unchanged\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdge cases:\\\\\\\\n- For very small boxes (no interior), nothing happens.\\\\\\\\n- For boxes at the edge, interior will be filled as normal as long as there is space\\\\\\\\n- Code will work for single or multiple boxes in one grid without overlap.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeneralization:\\\\\\\\n- The solution will apply to any axis-aligned, single-pixel-thick orange-bordered square in a binary/colored grid of any size, provided these are separated and not nested/intersecting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecision Reference:\\\\\\\\n- Borders are detected exclusively by color 1.\\\\\\\\n- Fill decision (green/gray) is made only by parity of enclosed square\\\\u2019s size.\\\\\\\\n- Background, orange shape, and all non-interior cells remain exactly as in input.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    output = input_matrix.copy()\\\\\\\\n    h, w = input_matrix.shape\\\\\\\\n    visited = np.zeros_like(input_matrix, dtype=bool)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    for i in range(h):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(w):\\\\\\\\n            if input_matrix[i, j] == 1 and not visited[i, j]:\\\\\\\\n                # Try to find the bounds of this orange-bordered box\\\\\\\\n                # Expand right and down to find the edge of the box\\\\\\\\n                right = j\\\\\\\\n                bottom = i\\\\\\\\n                while right + 1 < w and input_matrix[i, right + 1] == 1:\\\\\\\\n                    right += 1\\\\\\\\n                while bottom + 1 < h and input_matrix[bottom + 1, j] == 1:\\\\\\\\n                    bottom += 1\\\\\\\\n                # Now, verify that top, bottom, left, right forms a closed border:\\\\\\\\n                if right -
