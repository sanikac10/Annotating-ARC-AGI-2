    "user_explanation": "Observe, all matrices are the same. Like 8x8 input remains the same 8x8 for output. Or an 6x6 input remains the same 6x6 for output. However, observe the concentric circular or rather square pattern. See, an 8x8 means there can be 4 square outline inside, with smallest one being 2x2, then 4x4 borders only, then 6x6 borders only, and finally 8x8 borders only. However, understand what is happening while there's concentric squares, colors are being modified between input and output. Now for the first one the inner most and outer most squares exchange color, then the second and third-tiers exchange color. So it's primarily like say for each concentric square there was color_sequence_array then for 8x8 it'd have 4 values representing the colors of the 4 squares. For 6x6, it'll have 3 colors having colors for 3 squares.  for 10x10 there's 5 colors for each of the 5 squares. For 12x12 similarly 6 colors for each of the 6 squares. Now, say this array is input_color_sequence_array then output_color_sequence_array would simply be a flipped version of it so output_color_sequence_array[i] = input_color_sequence_array[N//2-i]\\nWhich is how we see all the patterns, in 6x6, the inner most and outer most interchange, middle one remaining the same. Same across the others. Now, lets think about how to get the color, assume that you get a numpy matrix called input_matrix, then in that case, your goal is to come up with input_color_sequence_array you can first assert its a square by doing width==height, then go 0,0 is the outermost color within input_color_sequence_array, so that'll be input_color_sequence_array[N//2-1], then 1,1 will be the color of input_color_sequence_array[N//2-2], ... and so on until you reach the diagonal cell (N//2, N//2). This will then return you a simple input_color_sequence_array, which can then be flipped to create output_color_sequence_array. Then since we've this concentric squares can be programmatically generated around it in that way.",
    "function_output": "[\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"understanding_the_images\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 1: Understanding the images\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll images (input/output pairs) display square grids of varying sizes, where each grid cell is filled with a color (numerically labeled). The arrangement of colors within each grid reveals a structure of concentric square layers (rings) centered in the grid. As we move from the outermost layer toward the center, each layer completely surrounds the next inner layer and all cells in a single layer share the same color. The number of consecutive layers is exactly half the length of the grid's side (e.g., an 8x8 grid has 4 layers, a 6x6 grid has 3 layers, etc.).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey universal properties across examples:\\\\\\\\n- All grids are perfect squares (height == width).\\\\\\\\n- The number of distinct layers is always N//2, where N is the grid's dimension.\\\\\\\\n- Each layer is a square ring: the outermost layer is at the border, the next layer is inset by 1, and so on. Each layer can be described by two indices: its offset from the edge (layer 0 is the border), and its thickness is 1 cell.\\\\\\\\n- The coloring pattern is constant across all cells within a given layer; no layer has multiple colors within the same ring.\\\\\\\\n- The output maintains the same grid size as the input; there is no cropping, padding, or resizing.\\\\\\\\n- In the output, the set of colors and their association with a grid layer are permuted versions of those in the input. Specifically, colors are reassigned between layers according to a strict rule.\\\\\\\\n- The reassignment rule is a mirror or reversal: the color of the k-th layer in input becomes the color of the (N//2 - k - 1)-th layer in output, where layers are counted from the outside inwards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, these grids are built from concentric, color-uniform square rings, and the transformation consists of reassigning these colors by flipping their layer order. All other geometric and size characteristics are preserved, and colors are not mixed or split within a single layer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPattern structure and regularity:\\\\\\\\n- Each layer is a constant-width (1 cell) square boundary, sequentially inset into the grid.\\\\\\\\n- There is no overlap between layers.\\\\\\\\n- No exceptions or irregularities in the pattern have been observed: every layer in every example follows this uniform structure.\\\\\\\\n- In grids with an odd number of layers, the central layer maps onto itself under the flipping operation.\\\\\\\\n- There is strong central symmetry: each layer's color assignment in the output is symmetric with respect to the center compared to the input.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese properties provide the foundation for a general approach to mapping input grids to output grids in this problem family.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep-by-Step Reasoning and Detailed Algorithm\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Assert Grid Properties:\\\\\\\\n   - Given a numpy matrix input_mat, check that it is a 2D square grid: N = input_mat.shape[0] == input_mat.shape[1].\\\\\\\\n   - Determine the number of layers: L = N // 2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Extract Input Color Sequence (color-by-layer):\\\\\\\\n   - For each layer index l from 0 to L-1:\\\\\\\\n     - The color at layer l can be read from cell (l, l) because, by construction, each layer forms a uniform square at that offset. Alternatively, any cell from the layer's perimeter can serve, since all are the same color in that layer.\\\\\\\\n   - Form input_color_sequence: a list such that input_color_sequence[l] = input_mat[l, l].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Compute Output Color Sequence (Layer Mapping):\\\\\\\\n   - The output_color_sequence is the reverse of the input_color_sequence: output_color_sequence[l] = input_color_sequence[L - l - 1].\\\\\\\\n   - This means the outermost layer receives the input's innermost color, the second layer receives the second-innermost, and so on.\\\\\\\\n   - If L is odd, the central layer's color remains on the same index.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Build Output Grid:\\\\\\\\n   - Create an output_mat of the same shape as input_mat.\\\\\\\\n   - For each cell (i, j) in output_mat:\\\\\\\\n     - Determine the layer index l for this cell: l = min(i, j, N - 1 - i, N - 1 - j)\\\\\\\\n       (since each layer is delineated by distance from the edge).\\\\\\\\n     - Assign output_mat[i, j] = output_color_sequence[l].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Edge Cases/Generalizations:\\\\\\\\n   - Pattern works for any even-sized square grid (the problem only showed even sizes, but can generalize to odd similarly; if odd, there will be a central cell/layer).\\\\\\\\n   - Assumes that layers are always uniform in color \\\\u2013 holds for all provided examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. Pseudocode:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef solve(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    N = input_mat.shape[0]\\\\\\\\n    assert N == input_mat.shape[1], \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Input must be a square matrix.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    L = N // 2\\\\\\\\n    input_color_sequence = [input_mat[l, l] for l in range(L)]\\\\\\\\n    output_color_sequence = input_color_sequence[::-1]\\\\\\\\n    output_mat = np.zeros_like(input_mat)\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(N):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(N):\\\\\\\\n            l = min(i, j, N - 1 - i, N - 1 - j)\\\\\\\\n            output_mat[i, j] = output_color_sequence[l]\\\\\\\\n    return output_mat\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. Testing Against Examples:\\\\\\\\n   - Apply the algorithm to all input grids; verify that the produced output grids have layer colors swapped according to the rules: outer and inner layers exchanged, subsequent pairs swapped, and central layer preserved if odd layers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. Justification:\\\\\\\\n   - The algorithm strictly follows the observed transformations: identifying each cell's layer, assembling the input layer-color pattern, reversing this pattern, and reconstructing the output layer-wise. The steps operate only on the properties universal to all observed images, guaranteeing generalization for all grids following this concentric-square pattern.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    N = input_matrix.shape[0]\\\\\\\\n    L = N // 2\\\\\\\\n    input_color_sequence = [input_matrix[l, l] for l in range(L)]\\\\\\\\n    output_color_sequence = input_color_sequence[::-1]\\\\\\\\n    output_matrix = np.zeros_like(input_matrix)\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(N):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(N):\\\\\\\\n            l = min(i, j, N - 1 - i, N - 1 - j)\\\\\\\\n            output_matrix[i, j] = output_color_sequence[l]\\\\\\\\n    return output_matrix\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
