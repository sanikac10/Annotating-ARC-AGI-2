    "user_explanation": "Observe the input and output matrices. They remain the same that is 4x4 for inputs or outputs. Something to note in the outputs, it only has green and pink, where we can see that pink is default. Now, then our question is there a pattern to the green, yes looking at all the outputs, we see all greens are in the form of 2x2 squares, in one of the corners of squares. Now, how to identify which corner, see in the input image which 2x2 corner it falls into, i.e. there's 4 available right [0:2, 0:2] or [2:4, 0:2] or [0:2, 2:4] or [2:4, 2:4] just see if green falls within one of them and color that entire 2x2 as green",

This is consistent in every instance presented.\\\\\\\\n- The grids use a palette of colors/numbers, each color associated with a number (relying on the visual representations):\\\\\\\\n  - Pink is the most frequent, and its position appears unchanged in outputs, suggesting it is the background/default color (visually corresponding to the value \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\n  - Green is always present as a block in the outputs and is always associated with the value \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n  - The inputs also contain additional colors (brown, blue, orange, yellow, purple, cyan/teal, etc.), each occupying single cells, whereas outputs exclude all except pink (6) and green (2).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPattern and Structure Observations:\\\\\\\\n- In every output, a 2x2 square of green (2) appears. This square is always located in one of the four possible corners of the 4x4 output matrix: top-left ([rows 0-1, columns 0-1]), top-right ([0-1,2-3]), bottom-left ([2-3,0-1]), bottom-right ([2-3,2-3]).\\\\\\\\n- The rest of the output matrix is entirely pink (6), matching the background of the input, regardless of what other numbers/colors appeared in the input.\\\\\\\\n- In the input, green (2) is always present at least once, but never more than once. The location of green in the input directly determines which corner will be green in the output. The green cell of the input always falls within exactly one of the four possible 2x2 corner regions, and the output sets this 2x2 region to green.\\\\\\\\n- All other special or unique colored cells in the input (orange 1, blue 0, brown 5, yellow 8, purple 4, cyan 9) are ignored in the output.\\\\\\\\n- If green (2) appears in the input at a position within a 2x2 corner, the corresponding corner in the output becomes a fully green 2x2. All other positions and colors are set to or maintained as pink (6).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetry and Invariance:\\\\\\\\n- There is no reflection, rotation, or symmetry involved in how green is selected in the output. It purely depends on the position of the green (2) cell in the input.\\\\\\\\n- Output is invariant to the presence, arrangement, or count of other (non-6, non-2) colors in the input. Only the green cell matters.\\\\\\\\n- Since possible corners are always the same, the procedure is universal for any 4x4 input with green (2) somewhere; corners do not overlap.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNumerical/Pattern Logical Properties:\\\\\\\\n- There are always four possible non-overlapping 2x2 corners on a 4x4 grid: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\\\\\\\\n- The output is determined by a simple positional rule: find where the (single) green cell is, mark that entire corner as green, rest as pink.\\\\\\\\n- Outputs are also always 4x4, no cropping or resizing ever occurs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPotential Generalization Rules:\\\\\\\\n- If there were no green (2) in the input, likely the output would remain all pink.\\\\\\\\n- If there were multiple green (2) present, the rule would be ambiguous; examples are always constrained to at most one present.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummary:\\\\\\\\n- The only transformation is: detect which 2x2 corner contains the green cell (2) in the input, and set that corner in the output grid to be all green, rest of the grid is pink. Ignore all other cell values/colors.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpanded Step-by-Step Solution:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Input Preparation:\\\\\\\\n    - Start with the given input matrix (input_mat), a 4x4 grid.\\\\\\\\n    - Initialize a result matrix (output_mat) of same size, filling every cell with the background color (pink: 6).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Locating the Green (2) Cell:\\\\\\\\n    - Scan every cell of input_mat for any cell containing the value 2.\\\\\\\\n    - Note its row (r) and column (c) indices. As per all examples, there will be exactly one such cell, so you can break after the first found.\\\\\\\\n    (If for robustness you wish to handle multiple or zero green cells, additional logic would be needed, but not relevant per the observed data.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Determining the Target 2x2 Corner:\\\\\\\\n    - There are four possible non-overlapping 2x2 subregions (corners):\\\\\\\\n        * Top-left: covering rows [0, 1], columns [0, 1]\\\\\\\\n        * Top-right: covering rows [0, 1], columns [2, 3]\\\\\\\\n        * Bottom-left: covering rows [2, 3], columns [0, 1]\\\\\\\\n        * Bottom-right: covering rows [2, 3], columns [2, 3]\\\\\\\\n    - Determine which corner contains the cell (r, c):\\\\\\\\n        * If 0 <= r <= 1 and 0 <= c <= 1: top-left\\\\\\\\n        * If 0 <= r <= 1 and 2 <= c <= 3: top-right\\\\\\\\n        * If 2 <= r <= 3 and 0 <= c <= 1: bottom-left\\\\\\\\n        * If 2 <= r <= 3 and 2 <= c <= 3: bottom-right\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Coloring the Output:\\\\\\\\n    - Once the relevant corner is identified, set all four cells of that 2x2 corner in output_mat to 2 (green).\\\\\\\\n    - All other cells remain as they were (6/pink).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Return output_mat as the result.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudo-code Implementation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef mark_green_corner(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    output_mat = np.full((4, 4), 6)  # Start with all pink (6)\\\\\\\\n    # Locate the green (2) cell\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(4):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(4):\\\\\\\\n            if input_mat[r, c] == 2:\\\\\\\\n                green_r, green_c = r, c\\\\\\\\n                break\\\\\\\\n    # Determine the corner\\\\\\\\n    if green_r < 2:\\\\\\\\n        row_start = 0\\\\\\\\n    else:\\\\\\\\n        row_start = 2\\\\\\\\n    if green_c < 2:\\\\\\\\n        col_start = 0\\\\\\\\n    else:\\\\\\\\n        col_start = 2\\\\\\\\n    # Paint the 2x2 corner green\\\\\\\\n    output_mat[row_start:row_start+2, col_start:col_start+2] = 2\\\\\\\\n    return output_mat\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting against Provided Examples:\\\\\\\\n- In each example, manually verify that the function:\\\\\\\\n    * Finds the correct green cell.\\\\\\\\n    * Paints the correct 2x2 corner green.\\\\\\\\n    * Leaves all other cells pink (6).\\\\\\\\n- Edge cases (not present, but for completeness):\\\\\\\\n    * If no green found, output remains all pink (6).\\\\\\\\n    * If two or more green cells, the first found (scan order) determines the corner (could be improved to raise error or handle multiple detection as undefined case).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeneralizations:\\\\\\\\n- The above algorithm is robust to the input having irrelevant colors or only a single green cell.\\\\\\\\n- It will work for any 4x4 matrix meeting the problem constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey Reasoning Steps:\\\\\\\\n- The only thing that matters is the position of the green (2) cell in the input.\\\\\\\\n- All other values and colors can be ignored for generating the output.\\\\\\\\n- The output is a mask selecting the relevant 2x2 corner aligned with green's position in the input, rest filled with background.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    output_matrix = np.full((4, 4), 6)  # Initialize the output with all 6s (pink)\\\\\\\\n    # Locate the green (2) cell\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(4):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(4):\\\\\\\\n            if input_matrix[r, c] == 2:\\\\\\\\n                green_r, green_c = r, c\\\\\\\\n                break\\\\\\\\n    # Determine which corner based on green cell position\\\\\\\\n    row_start = 0 if green_r < 2 else 2\\\\\\\\n    col_start = 0 if green_c < 2 else 2\\\\\\\\n    # Set the 2x2 corner to 2 (green)\\\\\\\\n    output_matrix[row_start:row_start+2, col_start:col_start+2] = 2\\\\\\\\n    return output_matrix\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
