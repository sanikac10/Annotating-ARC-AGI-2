Or primarily one can detect vertical green lines which exist across the matrices, one side of them, either left or right have a purple segment, which can be any pattern and however wide.

    "function_output": "[\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"understanding_the_images\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 1: Understanding the images\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGrid Properties:\\\\\\\\n- All inputs and outputs are rectangular matrices, usually 16x16 or 14x16 or 16x18. There is no addition or removal of rows or columns between input and output.\\\\\\\\n- The grids are filled mostly with a background color (0, blue), and contain patterns formed mostly by green (2), purple (4), brown (5), yellow (8), red (3), orange (1), or gray (7) cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsistent Elements:\\\\\\\\n- Green (2) segments form straight vertical lines in all cases; these vertical lines can be of varying lengths but are always unbroken (single column, consecutive rows).\\\\\\\\n- Purple (4) segments are always clustered alongside these green lines, either wholly on the left or right side, adjacent and possibly extending several columns away from the green line. Purple segments can vary in shape and size, including rectangular, L-shape, or wider blocks.\\\\\\\\n- The vertical green lines and their immediate purple segments do not move\\\\u2014they retain their position, shape, and color between input and output.\\\\\\\\n- In the output, the original positions of green (2) and purple (4) segments are preserved exactly from the input.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTransformed Elements:\\\\\\\\n- On the opposite side of each green line (from where purple occurs in the input), a new pattern appears in the output. This new pattern is a mirrored version (left-right reflection) of the purple segment across the green line.\\\\\\\\n- The mirrored pattern receives a new color, matching the non-background, non-green, non-purple color present in the input, somewhere on the mirrored side (could be brown, yellow, orange, red, gray, etc.). This color is not always present beside every green line in every example, but when it appears, it informs the color of the mirrored region.\\\\\\\\n- The output replaces the background (0) on the mirrored side with the new color in the exact mirrored shape, without disturbing any original non-background pixels already present.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpatial and Numerical Features:\\\\\\\\n- Each green line only acts on its own local purple segment; there is never a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"shared\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" pattern or global mirroring.\\\\\\\\n- Not every green line has a corresponding mirror if there is no purple segment next to it.\\\\\\\\n- Mirrored patterns never overwrite green or purple; they fill only empty (background=0) cells.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeneral Pattern:\\\\\\\\n- The grid acts as a canvas where, for every green vertical line, you: 1) identify the adjacent purple shape on one side, and 2) mirror that exact pattern to the opposite side of the green line, repainting it with the special color found on that side (if any; otherwise possibly a default or no fill).\\\\\\\\n- The color used for the mirrored region may differ\\\\u2014there may be one or multiple unique colors in the grid (as in the test example).\\\\\\\\n- There may be multiple green lines, and the algorithm must handle each separately, possibly with a different mirrored shape or color.\\\\\\\\n- Non-green, non-purple, non-bg color cells (e.g. 3, 1, 8, 5, 7) act only as color guides for mirroring, and their original locations remain unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary: Every green vertical line is an axis for a specific left-right reflection of adjacent purple patterns, and the mirrored shape gets recolored according to the distinct color available on the mirrored side. The rest of the pixels remain unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Matrix Copy and Preparation:\\\\\\\\n   - Start by copying the input matrix to the output. This guarantees that all unchanged colors (including green and purple segments, as well as fixed color hints) are preserved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Identify Green Vertical Lines:\\\\\\\\n   - Scan every column of the matrix for contiguous vertical runs of green (2) cells. Record for each such run the start and end rows, and the column index. Each green vertical line forms an axis for mirroring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. For Each Green Vertical Line:\\\\\\\\n   a. Determine Adjacent Purple (4) Segment and Its Side:\\\\\\\\n      - For every row the green line occupies, check immediate left and right columns for purple cells (4). As soon as you find purple, record which side (left or right) it is on.\\\\\\\\n      - For robustness, if purple is not found immediately adjacent, scan outwards for the first purple connected to the green\\\\u2014this accounts for wider patterns.\\\\\\\\n      - If neither side has purple nearby for the span, skip this green line (nothing to mirror).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   b. Extract Connected Purple Block:\\\\\\\\n      - Starting from all purple (4) cells adjacent to the green line (on the detected side), use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) to collect the entire purple shape. Every connected purple cell (including diagonals, if the pattern permits) is included. Keep track of the coordinates of the purple pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   c. Find Mirror Color from the Opposite Side:\\\\\\\\n      - On the opposite side of the green line (i.e., the side where purple doesn\\\\u2019t exist in input), scan for the nearest non-bg (not 0), non-green (not 2), non-purple (not 4) color for each row in the green span. As soon as you find such a cell, record its color; you only need one, as the mirrored region will be uniformly recolored.\\\\\\\\n      - If no such cell exists in the relevant region, you may skip mirroring or use a problem-determined default color (all examples so far have a clear candidate color per region).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   d. Mirror and Recolor the Pattern:\\\\\\\\n      - For every cell in the connected purple shape (row, col), compute its mirrored coordinate across the green line:\\\\\\\\n         - If purple is to the left and green_col = G, mirrored_col = G + (G - col)\\\\\\\\n         - If purple is to the right, mirrored_col = G - (col - G)\\\\\\\\n      - Only set the output cell if it is a background (0) in the input at that location, and within bounds.\\\\\\\\n      - Color the mirrored region with the found color.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - Move to the next green line and repeat steps a-d.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.

No original non-0 cells are altered except for these deliberate fills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummary: The process detects green axes, finds/preserves adjacent purple blocks, mirrors and recolors them on the opposite side using observed color cues, and composes the final grid, handling all spatial relationship, color, and edge nuances, as demonstrated in the three sample pairs.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\nfrom collections import deque\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    input_mat = np.array(input_matrix)\\\\\\\\n    out = input_mat.copy()\\\\\\\\n    rows, cols = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def find_vertical_green_lines(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n        greens = []\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(cols):\\\\\\\\n            start = None\\\\\\\\n            for r in range(rows):\\\\\\\\n                if input_mat[r, c] == 2:\\\\\\\\n                    if start is None:\\\\\\\\n                        start = r\\\\\\\\n                else:\\\\\\\\n                    if start is not None:\\\\\\\\n                        greens.append((start, c, r-1, c))\\\\\\\\n                        start = None\\\\\\\\n            if start is not None:\\\\\\\\n                greens.append((start, c, rows-1, c))\\\\\\\\n        return greens\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def find_purple_side(green_line):\\\\\\\\n        s, c, e, _ = green_line\\\\\\\\n        left = right = 0\\\\\\\\n        for r in range(s, e+1):\\\\\\\\n            if c > 0 and input_mat[r, c-1] == 4: left += 1\\\\\\\\n            if c < cols-1 and input_mat[r, c+1] == 4: right += 1\\\\\\\\n        if left == 0 and right == 0: return \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        return 'left' if left >= right else 'right'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def get_connected_purple(s, e, g_col, side):\\\\\\\\n        pattern = set()\\\\\\\\n        def valid(r, c):\\\\\\\\n            return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and input_mat[r, c] == 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        dq = deque()\\\\\\\\n        if side == 'left':\\\\\\\\n            for r in range(s, e+1):\\\\\\\\n                for c in range(g_col-1, -1, -1):\\\\\\\\n                    if input_mat[r, c] == 4:\\\\\\\\n                        dq.append((r, c))\\\\\\\\n                        pattern.add((r, c))\\\\\\\\n                        break\\\\\\\\n            visited = set(pattern)\\\\\\\\n            while dq:\\\\\\\\n                r, c = dq.popleft()\\\\\\\\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\\\\\\\\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\\\\\\\\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\\\\\\\\n                        if valid(nr, nc) and (nr, nc) not in visited:\\\\\\\\n                            dq.append((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                            pattern.add((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n        else:\\\\\\\\n            for r in range(s, e+1):\\\\\\\\n                for c in range(g_col+1, cols):\\\\\\\\n                    if input_mat[r, c] == 4:\\\\\\\\n                        dq.append((r, c))\\\\\\\\n                        pattern.add((r, c))\\\\\\\\n                        break\\\\\\\\n            visited = set(pattern)\\\\\\\\n            while dq:\\\\\\\\n                r, c = dq.popleft()\\\\\\\\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\\\\\\\\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\\\\\\\\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\\\\\\\\n                        if valid(nr, nc) and (nr, nc) not in visited:\\\\\\\\n                            dq.append((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                            pattern.add((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n        return list(pattern)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def get_mirror_color(s, e, g_col, side):\\\\\\\\n        drn = 1 if side == 'left' else -1\\\\\\\\n        for r in range(s, e+1):\\\\\\\\n            c = g_col + drn\\\\\\\\n            while 0 <= c < cols:\\\\\\\\n                v = input_mat[r, c]\\\\\\\\n                if v not in (0, 2, 4):\\\\\\\\n                    return v\\\\\\\\n                c += drn\\\\\\\\n        return -1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def mirror_and_color(purple_pixels, g_col, side, color):\\\\\\\\n        for (r, c) in purple_pixels:\\\\\\\\n            if side == 'left':\\\\\\\\n                mc = g_col + (g_col -
