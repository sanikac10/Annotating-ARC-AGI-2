    "user_explanation": "So you see, it goes from 2x2 to 6x6 which means it's tripled across all dimensions, as you can see the first two rows of the output matrix is simply the input matrix horizontally repeated thrice. Then the second set of two output rows, i.e. 3, & 4 is in essence are horizontally flipped and repeated thrice again. The final 2 rows of the output 5 & 6 are the same as the first three rows, i.e. they're simply three horizontally aligned repetitions of the the og input matrix.",
    "function_output": "[\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"understanding_the_images\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 1: Understanding the images\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAcross all image pairs, we are presented with two types of matrices per example:\\\\\\\\n- The input is always a 2x2 grid where each cell is filled with a distinct color and an overlaid number (as a label, not as part of the transformation logic).\\\\\\\\n- The output is always a 6x6 grid, using the same set of four colors and respective positions as in the input, but expanded and repeated. The numbers, which are for visualization, are distributed in a specific arrangement. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnalyzing these matrices:\\\\\\\\n- Color/number associations are maintained between corresponding regions in input and output, i.e., the color and number in the top left of the input appear (possibly repeatedly) in certain regions of the output.\\\\\\\\n- The output\\\\u2019s size is always 6x6, which is exactly three times the input\\\\u2019s height and width (if input is HxW then output is 3H x 3W).\\\\\\\\n- The output can be visually divided into nine 2x2 blocks (3 rows x 3 columns of 2x2 each), each apparently being a copy of the 2x2 input matrix but possibly transformed.\\\\\\\\n- The first (topmost) and last (bottommost) pairs of rows in the output are direct horizontal replications of the input matrix, repeated side-by-side thrice.\\\\\\\\n- The middle pair of rows (rows 3-4 in the output) are horizontal flips of the input matrix, repeated side-by-side thrice. That is, the left and right columns within the input matrix are swapped before tiling.\\\\\\\\n- These patterns are consistent across all examples, regardless of the specific colors or numbers used.\\\\\\\\n- There is clear tiling and flipping symmetry: output rows [0-1] and [4-5] match, while rows [2-3] are mirrored versions of the input.\\\\\\\\n- Horizontally, each 2-column segment is always a copy of the input (or its flipped variant, depending on the row pair), repeated for each pair of rows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat changes:\\\\\\\\n- The size scales from 2x2 to 6x6, a factor of 3 in both dimensions.\\\\\\\\n- The arrangement flips in the middle segment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat remains constant:\\\\\\\\n- The local relation of colors or values to their input positions (with or without flipping as appropriate).\\\\\\\\n- The order of blocks across matching row segments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis overall pattern is invariant to the specific colors or numbers, and applies universally for the provided examples.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can explicitly lay out the algorithm as follows, based on the above analysis and the human explanation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 1: Start with a given input_mat of size 2x2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2: Construct a horizontally flipped version of input_mat; call this input_flip. For a 2x2 input, horizontal flip swaps columns:\\\\\\\\n  input_flip = input_mat[:, ::-1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 3: Prepare three sets of 2-row blocks for the output:\\\\\\\\n  - Top two rows (rows 0-1): horizontally repeat the original input_mat three times.\\\\\\\\n  - Middle two rows (rows 2-3): horizontally repeat the horizontally flipped input_mat three times.\\\\\\\\n  - Bottom two rows (rows 4-5): same as the first two rows, repeat input_mat three times horizontally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 4: Vertically stack the three row pairs, to make a final shape of (6,6):\\\\\\\\n  output = np.vstack([\\\\\\\\n      np.hstack([input_mat] * 3),       # Rows 0-1\\\\\\\\n      np.hstack([input_flip] * 3),      # Rows 2-3\\\\\\\\n      np.hstack([input_mat] * 3)        # Rows 4-5\\\\\\\\n  ])\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 5: Return or visualize the resulting output matrix.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudocode:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef generate_output(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    # Step 1: Original and flipped\\\\\\\\n    input_flip = input_mat[:, ::-1]\\\\\\\\n    # Step 2: Prepare output rows\\\\\\\\n    top = np.hstack([input_mat] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    middle = np.hstack([input_flip] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    bottom = np.hstack([input_mat] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    # Step 3: Stack to get output\\\\\\\\n    output = np.vstack([\\\\\\\\n        top,\\\\\\\\n        middle,\\\\\\\\n        bottom\\\\\\\\n    ])\\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting on provided examples:\\\\\\\\n- Example 1: Given any 2x2, the output is constructed as above, with numbers/colors lining up exactly as in the output images shown.\\\\\\\\n- Example 2: Ditto, with its unique color arrangement preserved and block pattern held.\\\\\\\\n- Test Case: Again, regardless of the numbers/colors, the same mirroring and tiling occurs, producing the expected 6x6 output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdge Cases and Generalizations:\\\\\\\\n- The pattern is strictly for 2x2 input to 6x6 output. The solution generalizes only as far as the exact tiling/flipping rules are followed; for other input dimensions or scale-factors, rules would have to be adjusted accordingly.\\\\\\\\n- The algorithm is agnostic to the actual color or number values\\\\u2014only their positions and arrangements matter.\\\\\\\\n- The pattern would break for inputs not of 2x2 size.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinal Summary:\\\\\\\\nThe transformation involves tiling and flipping the 2x2 input in a 3x3 block arrangement so that the output is a 6x6 grid, following specific horizontal repetition and flipping steps as detailed above.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    # Create a horizontally flipped version of the input matrix\\\\\\\\n    input_flip = input_matrix[:, ::-1]\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Prepare the output matrix by stacking the appropriate rows\\\\\\\\n    top = np.hstack([input_matrix] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    middle = np.hstack([input_flip] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    bottom = np.hstack([input_matrix] * 3)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    output = np.vstack([top, middle, bottom])\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
