    "user_explanation": "So, all shapes between input and outputs are the same. Before we begin exploring the matrix, somethings to note, while there's 14 columns - the first column acts as a separator explained in detail ahead and the last-column acts only as the sparse vector assuming its dense column exists beyond it but not present. So, the patterned column bars are: 0 - separator, [1,2] - first pattern, 3 - separator, [4,5] - second pattern, 6 - separator, [7,8] - third pattern, 9 - separator, [10,11] - fourth pattern, 12 - separator, and finally [13, onyl sparse here] - sparse column version of the pattern, with the assumption that 14th exists if reorder, again discussed below. So, the pattern is: [Separator, Sparse, Dense] in this exact order of 3. Hence, matrix itself isn't changing. However, there seem to particular patterns (horizontally that exist) at intervals of 3 columns with a spacing column to separate them. Thus all columnar or vertical patterns encompass two columns with one separator column. Now, we can notice that there's a total of 5 columnar patterns for each input image that each encompass two columns, one which is a completely filled column and another one which is sparse, now if we count the number of filled cells in the columns which are sparse, we see that there's like 2 filled, then 4 filled, then 6 filled, then 5 filled, then 1 filled for the first image. In the output one retaining the patterns they're ordered in descending order: wherein the first columnar pattern has the highest, that is 6 of the shaded cells, then 5, then 4, then 2, then 1. Now, let's explore the second example. We have again 5 columnar patterns, wherein the sparse counts column-wise are 3, 5, 1, 4, 2 --> now we see in the output it becomes 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. However, the patterns for each columnar pattern is retained which means it's a cut-paste.",

This structure is preserved across all examples.\\\\\\\\n- The color palette includes at least three visually distinct values per instance: two for patterns (one dense, one sparse) and one for separator columns, with the actual numbers used varying per grid (e.g., 0, 1, 7, 6, etc.).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nColumnar Organization:\\\\\\\\n- The grid can be logically partitioned into a sequence of repeating vertical groups or clusters. Each \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" spans three columns:\\\\\\\\n    - The first column (leftmost in each group) acts as a separator (often all background or a specific uniform color/value, e.g., all 1, 7, or 6 depending on the example), visually and logically separating blocks.\\\\\\\\n    - The next two columns form a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"columnar pattern\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\n        - One is densely filled (all the same non-background value).\\\\\\\\n        - The other is sparsely filled (same non-background value sparsely distributed amidst background/zeroes).\\\\\\\\n    - After all full groups, the final column (column 13, 0-indexed) is always a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sparse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" column\\\\u2014the right half of an incomplete group with no following dense pair (sometimes interpreted as if the next (dense) column existed off-grid for sorting/reordering logic cases).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Across 14 columns, the groupings are: [separator, sparse, dense, separator, sparse, dense, separator, sparse, dense, separator, sparse, dense, separator, sparse-only]. There are five such pattern pairs per grid, with corresponding separator columns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPattern and Color Analysis:\\\\\\\\n- Within each group, the dense column and its paired sparse column always use the same values - i.e., for a group, they act as a logical unit and are visually distinguishable from their neighbors, with the separator enforcing boundaries. The only change across instances is what numerical value is used for each (but within one instance, columns in the same group use the same pair of values: e.g., both 0/1, both 6/0, etc.).\\\\\\\\n- The number of filled/non-background cells per sparse column differs between groups but is consistent within the before/after comparison for that pattern. The dense column is always fully filled, the sparse column varies in its fill pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Changes/Remains Constant:\\\\\\\\n- The grid size, separator style, and number of groups remain constant from input to output.\\\\\\\\n- The only change is in the relative ordering (left to right, i.e., group position) of these triple-column pattern groups. The internal structure and the actual cell patterns of dense and sparse columns themselves are unaltered (patterns are preserved, only their order among groupings shifts).\\\\\\\\n- Separator columns, their coloring and position, remain fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpatial Relationships and Symmetry:\\\\\\\\n- There is no rotational, reflective, or translational transformation applied within the patterns; only the order of pattern groups changes.\\\\\\\\n- The transformation is a global (entire group-wise) sorting or permutation\\\\u2014patterns are picked up and moved together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNumerical/Quantitative Properties:\\\\\\\\n- Each group can be quantified by the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sparse fill count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\u2014the number of non-background cells in each sparse column.\\\\\\\\n- Output order for these groups is always descending (most filled sparse pattern leftmost, least rightmost), apart from separator columns that maintain their original positions.\\\\\\\\n- The dense and sparse columns in each group are always kept together as a unit, without mixing between groups.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConditional Rules:\\\\\\\\n- Separator columns are not shifted or affected by the transformation; only the groups between them are rearranged.\\\\\\\\n- Incomplete final group (last column) is treated as a separate sparse-only group for ordering purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummary:\\\\\\\\n- Visually, the transformation from input to output preserves all local intra-group structure, color, and separator positioning. It only reorders the triple-column pattern groups by the count of non-background cells in their sparse columns in descending order, left to right.\\\\\\\\n- There is no alteration of the numerical values within the grid, only their arrangement at group level.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep-by-Step Detailed Reasoning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Identify and Index the Groups:**\\\\\\\\n   - Partition the matrix into consecutive triples: separator column, sparse column, dense column, repeating, ending with a final separator and then a trailing sparse column (possibly unpaired at the end if column count is not a multiple of 3). For this problem, due to 14 columns, we get five groups\\\\u2014each consisting of: [separator, sparse, dense], with the last one being [separator, sparse] only.\\\\\\\\n   - Track the absolute column indices of all pattern groups and their subparts for reference during reconstruction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Extract and Analyze Sparse Columns:**\\\\\\\\n   - For each group, identify the sparse column (second in triple or the lone at the very end).\\\\\\\\n   - Count the number of filled cells (cells not equal to the separator/background value) in each sparse column. Compile these counts, associating each with their corresponding full pattern group (dense + sparse, or sparse only at end).\\\\\\\\n   - Example: For group 1 (cols 1-2), count filled cells in column 1 (sparse); for group 2 (cols 4-5), count column 4; ... for group 5 (col 13), just that column.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Sort the Groups by Sparse Column Fill Count:**\\\\\\\\n   - Produce a list of tuples: (pattern group array (including separator, sparse, dense), fill count), one tuple for each group (except the final group which has only [separator, sparse]).\\\\\\\\n   - Sort this list in descending order based on the fill count of the sparse column in each group, preserving ties as per their original order if necessary.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Reconstruct Output Matrix:**\\\\\\\\n   - Create a new zero matrix of the same shape as input.\\\\\\\\n   - Place the groups back into the matrix in their new sorted order from left to right, preserving their internal triple-column structure. Separator columns must still partition each group as they did in the input. For the final group (if sparse-only), append it in proper order as a trailing tail.\\\\\\\\n   - Do NOT modify the content of any group (sparse/dense columns and their values must match the original, only position among groups changes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:**\\\\\\\\n   - If multiple groups have the same fill count, their original left-to-right ordering can be preserved (stable sort). Final group with only a sparse column is always treated as a full group for ordering and placement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. **Verification/Testing:**\\\\\\\\n   - For all example pairs, the output matrix (post-reordering) must have:\\\\\\\\n     - All group blocks intact and unaltered (apart from rearrangement).\\\\\\\\n     - Separator columns restored to their original spacing.\\\\\\\\n     - Groups ordered by descending number of filled cells in sparse columns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. **Generalization:**\\\\\\\\n   - This scheme works for any grid divisible into such patterns, including other grid sizes or color-codes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudocode:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef reorder_patterns(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    n_rows, n_cols = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    groups = []\\\\\\\\n    group_indices = []\\\\\\\\n    col = 0\\\\\\\\n    # Build list of (separator, sparse, dense) groups\\\\\\\\n    while col < n_cols:\\\\\\\\n        sep_col = input_mat[:, col:col+1]\\\\\\\\n        if col+2 < n_cols:\\\\\\\\n            sparse_col = input_mat[:, col+1:col+2]\\\\\\\\n            dense_col = input_mat[:, col+2:col+3]\\\\\\\\n            group = np.concatenate([sep_col, sparse_col, dense_col], axis=1)\\\\\\\\n            fill_count = np.sum(sparse_col != sep_col[0,0]) # assumes separator col value is the base\\\\\\\\n            groups.append((group, fill_count))\\\\\\\\n            group_indices.append((col, col+1, col+2))\\\\\\\\n            col += 3\\\\\\\\n        else:\\\\\\\\n            # Last partial group (only sep+sparse)\\\\\\\\n            sparse_col = input_mat[:, col+1:col+2] if col+1 < n_cols else None\\\\\\\\n            if sparse_col is not None:\\\\\\\\n                group = np.concatenate([sep_col, sparse_col], axis=1)\\\\\\\\n                fill_count = np.sum(sparse_col != sep_col[0,0])\\\\\\\\n                groups.append((group, fill_count))\\\\\\\\n                group_indices.append((col, col+1))\\\\\\\\n            col += 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Sort groups by fill_count in descending order (stable)\\\\\\\\n    groups_sorted = sorted(groups, key=lambda g: -g[1])\\\\\\\\n    # Build output\\\\\\\\n    output_mat = np.zeros_like(input_mat)\\\\\\\\n    pos = 0\\\\\\\\n    for group, _ in groups_sorted:\\\\\\\\n        out_span = group.shape[1]\\\\\\\\n        output_mat[:, pos:pos+out_span] = group\\\\\\\\n        pos += out_span\\\\\\\\n    return output_mat\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting (high-level):\\\\\\\\n- Apply to each example; verify output exactly matches expected grid.\\\\\\\\n- Edge cases: input where multiple sparse columns have same fill count, or last group is only [sep,sparse], or all columns are dense/sparse.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReferences:\\\\\\\\n- Visual groups, column count logic, separator consistency, and group-wise fill counts as justified by the structured analysis above.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"def convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    input_mat = np.array(input_matrix)\\\\\\\\n    n_rows, n_cols = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    groups = []\\\\\\\\n    col = 0\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    while col < n_cols:\\\\\\\\n        sep_col = input_mat[:, col:col+1]\\\\\\\\n        if col+2 < n_cols:\\\\\\\\n            sparse_col = input_mat[:, col+1:col+2]\\\\\\\\n            dense_col = input_mat[:, col+2:col+3]\\\\\\\\n            group = np.concatenate([sep_col, sparse_col, dense_col], axis=1)\\\\\\\\n            fill_count = np.sum(sparse_col != sep_col[0,0])\\\\\\\\n            groups.append((group, fill_count))\\\\\\\\n            col += 3\\\\\\\\n        else:\\\\\\\\n            sparse_col = input_mat[:, col+1:col+2] if col+1 < n_cols else None\\\\\\\\n            if sparse_col is not None:\\\\\\\\n                group = np.concatenate([sep_col, sparse_col], axis=1)\\\\\\\\n                fill_count = np.sum(sparse_col != sep_col[0,0])\\\\\\\\n                groups.append((group, fill_count))\\\\\\\\n            col += 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    groups_sorted = sorted(groups, key=lambda g: -g[1])\\\\\\\\n    output_mat = np.zeros_like(input_mat)\\\\\\\\n    pos = 0\\\\\\\\n    for group, _ in groups_sorted:\\\\\\\\n        out_span = group.shape[1]\\\\\\\\n        output_mat[:, pos:pos+out_span] = group\\\\\\\\n        pos += out_span\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    return output_mat.tolist()\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
