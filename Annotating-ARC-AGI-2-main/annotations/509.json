    "user_explanation": "Observe the input and output matrices. They remain the same that is 8x8 or whatever it was. Now, most of the structure/pattern also remains the same between input and output, it is primarily the colors which are getting modified drastically. Something to note: gray seems to be default and so does purple which do not modify between input and output pairs. Neither do the structures actually but rather their colors, thus first objective is to find the other structures attached to at least one of the corners of the input-matrix then identify all cells that belong to them based on having a common color, now for some images two corners share the same space, that's ok there can be fewer than 4 shapes its ok. Once identified then follow shape order in order of top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. or if lesser than 4 shapes accordingly reduce it. Then simply move color one ahead with moduli, thus changing color in a clockwise fashion. Recolor all patterns thus preserving them but only changin color and return the output matrix. Think like: Can we make it easier like fucking start from each corner, see what color that corner is everything in the matrix with that color is now seen and part of that shape, go to next corner check if visited? no that means new color, add new shape, i.e. set of cells with that same color, do this now. The order of corner visitation has to be top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left thus creating order, then clockwise move, retain cells just move colors and recolor. Example code: import numpy as np\n\ndef transform_matrix(input_matrix):\n    # Create a copy of the input matrix for the output\n    output_matrix = np.copy(input_matrix)\n    rows, cols = input_matrix.shape\n    \n    # Define non-changing colors (purple and gray)\n    # Assuming 4 is purple and 7 is gray (based on examples)\n    non_changing_colors = {4, 7}\n    \n    # Define corners in clockwise order\n    corners = [(0, 0), (0, cols-1), (rows-1, cols-1), (rows-1, 0)]\n    \n    # Initialize arrays to store corner regions\n    corner_colors = []\n    corner_regions = []\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Step 1: Start from each corner and identify regions\n    for corner in corners:\n        i, j = corner\n        color = input_matrix[i, j]\n        \n        # Skip if this corner color has already been processed or is non-changing\n        if color in non_changing_colors or color in corner_colors:\n            continue\n        \n        # Find all cells with this color\n        region = []\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if input_matrix[r, c] == color:\n                    region.append((r, c))\n                    visited.add((r, c))\n        \n        corner_colors.append(color)\n        corner_regions.append(region)\n    \n    # Step 2: Create color mapping for clockwise rotation\n    if len(corner_colors) > 1:  # Only rotate if we have at least 2 corner regions\n        color_map = {}\n        for i in range(len(corner_colors)):\n            next_idx = (i + 1) % len(corner_colors)\n            from_color = corner_colors[i]\n            to_color = corner_colors[next_idx]\n            color_map[from_color] = to_color\n        \n        # Step 3: Apply color transformation\n        for i in range(rows):\n            for j in range(cols):\n                color = input_matrix[i, j]\n                if color in color_map:  # Only transform colors that are in our map\n                    output_matrix[i, j] = color_map[color]\n    \n    return output_matrix",
    "function_output": "[\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"understanding_the_images\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 1: Understanding the images\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamining all the provided image pairs, we can observe a number of recurring visual and structural properties:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Grid Consistency: All input and output matrices are of size 8x8. The output always has the same dimensions as the input.\\\\\\\\n- Color Distribution: Each grid is filled with cells of certain colors, each color corresponding to an integer. Notably, most grids feature prominent contiguous regions of uniform color, often starting from one or more corners.\\\\\\\\n- Invariant Regions: The interior regions\\\\u2014especially those with colors corresponding to purple (4) and gray (7)\\\\u2014do not change between input and output. Their patterns, sizes, and locations are unchanged, and neither color is recolored in transformation.\\\\\\\\n- Corner-Connected Regions: Apart from purple and gray, there are up to four other colors present. Each of these colors is spatially grouped and always includes one of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Occasionally, not all four corners are occupied by a unique color (e.g., two corners may share the same color region, or there may be less than four such shapes).\\\\\\\\n- Region Identification: Each colored region can be visually identified by the following procedure: for each corner, find the color at that corner, then all cells in the grid with that color are considered as one region (unless they\\\\u2019re purple or gray\\\\u2014which are excluded from transformation).\\\\\\\\n- Color Cycling in Output: Each colored region identified in the above manner is recolored in a cyclical fashion: the color in the top-left moves to the top-right region, top-right to bottom-right, bottom-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-left. The recoloring is only for these corner-attached regions.\\\\\\\\n- Full-Region Transformation: All cells of a given region are recolored to the new mapped color, regardless of their position in the grid.\\\\\\\\n- Symmetry/Order: The only symmetry exploited here is the fixed clockwise ordering of corners (starting at top-left), to induce a deterministic color cycle.\\\\\\\\n- Pattern Robustness: Shapes and regions defined by non-corner, non-cycled colors (specifically purple/gray) are never modified. Their boundaries and position in the grid are preserved.\\\\\\\\n- Conditionality: The rule triggers only for regions attached to a color not in the invariant set (purple/gray), and only if those colors are present at the corners.\\\\\\\\n- Region Overlap: When two corners share the same color, that region simply participates once; there can be less than four mapped shapes.\\\\\\\\n- Color Frequency: Each color-to-shape mapping is exhaustive for all their cells within the grid, regardless of geometry or adjacency beyond color and corner attachment.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s translate these findings and the human explanation into a thorough, stepwise algorithm with reasoned justifications:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 1: Identification of Invariant Colors\\\\\\\\n- First, recognize that colors like purple (4) and gray (7) play a special role: they never change. Therefore, any transformation logic must exclude these colors both when identifying regions to recolor and when cycling colors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2: Define Corner Ordering and Target Regions\\\\\\\\n- Assign a fixed, clockwise ordering to matrix corners: top-left (0,0), top-right (0,N-1), bottom-right (N-1,N-1), bottom-left (N-1,0). Here N=8 for these problems.\\\\\\\\n- For each corner, inspect the color. If that color is neither an invariant nor already observed for another corner, gather all cells in the matrix of that color\\\\u2014this defines a single region.\\\\\\\\n- Ensure each corner contributes at most one candidate region (skip if duplicate or invariant). This process may yield anywhere from zero up to four regions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 3: Establish Color Cycling Mapping\\\\\\\\n- List all candidate region colors in the clockwise-corner order of their associated corner. If a color appears at multiple corners, only include it once.\\\\\\\\n- Create a mapping: the color at position i in the list is mapped to the color at the next index (modulo the length\\\\u2014so the last color wraps to the first). This map defines how input colors get cycled in the output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 4: Recolor the Matrix\\\\\\\\n- For every cell in the input matrix, if its color appears in the constructed mapping, change it to the mapped color in the output. Otherwise, leave it unchanged (i.e., purple and gray, as well as any unassigned background, remain as is).\\\\\\\\n- Importantly, this means that a region\\\\u2019s geometry is preserved, but its color changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 5: Output Construction and Validation\\\\\\\\n- The transformed output matrix is constructed as above, and its shape matches the input.\\\\\\\\n- Visually, the result will appear as if the colored corners \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"rotate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" their colors in a clockwise fashion while the internal, unchanging regions remain visually unaffected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 6: Edge Cases and Robustness\\\\\\\\n- If there are fewer than four regions (e.g., duplicate corner colors, or only two non-invariant corners occupied), simply cycle among available regions.\\\\\\\\n- If no non-invariant corner colors are present, the matrix remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\n- Test with all example pairs and confirm visual and structural results match expectation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\nPseudocode:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef rotate_corner_colors(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    output = np.copy(input_mat)\\\\\\\\n    rows, cols = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    invariant_colors = {4, 7}\\\\\\\\n    corners = [(0,0), (0,cols-1), (rows-1,cols-1), (rows-1,0)]\\\\\\\\n    region_colors = []\\\\\\\\n    visited_colors = set()\\\\\\\\n    # Identify corner-region colors in clockwise order\\\\\\\\n    for ci, cj in corners:\\\\\\\\n        color = input_mat[ci, cj]\\\\\\\\n        if color not in invariant_colors and color not in visited_colors:\\\\\\\\n            region_colors.append(color)\\\\\\\\n            visited_colors.add(color)\\\\\\\\n    # Build mapping to next color\\\\\\\\n    color_map = {}\\\\\\\\n    for idx, color in enumerate(region_colors):\\\\\\\\n        next_color = region_colors[(idx+1) % len(region_colors)]\\\\\\\\n        color_map[color] = next_color\\\\\\\\n    # Apply mapping\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(rows):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(cols):\\\\\\\\n            val = input_mat[r, c]\\\\\\\\n            if val in color_map:\\\\\\\\n                output[r, c] = color_map[val]\\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting:\\\\\\\\n- Apply the above logic to every sample input. For each, confirm that only the colored regions attached to corners are cycled (in clockwise order), with the rest untouched. Confirm against all provided input-output pairs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdge Cases:\\\\\\\\n- Only one region in corners: No visible change.\\\\\\\\n- More than four colors in grid: Only those attached to corners and not excluded as invariants are cycled.\\\\\\\\n- Less than four eligible regions: Only cycle among present ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll visual evidence and the provided examples corroborate that the described process and the implementation will robustly solve the problem class.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    output = np.copy(input_matrix)\\\\\\\\n    rows, cols = input_matrix.shape\\\\\\\\n    invariant_colors = {4, 7}\\\\\\\\n    corners = [(0,0), (0,cols-1), (rows-1,cols-1), (rows-1,0)]\\\\\\\\n    region_colors = []\\\\\\\\n    visited_colors = set()\\\\\\\\n    # Identify corner-region colors in clockwise order\\\\\\\\n    for ci, cj in corners:\\\\\\\\n        color = input_matrix[ci, cj]\\\\\\\\n        if color not in invariant_colors and color not in visited_colors:\\\\\\\\n            region_colors.append(color)\\\\\\\\n            visited_colors.add(color)\\\\\\\\n    # Build mapping to next color\\\\\\\\n    color_map = {}\\\\\\\\n    for idx, color in enumerate(region_colors):\\\\\\\\n        next_color = region_colors[(idx+1) % len(region_colors)]\\\\\\\\n        color_map[color] = next_color\\\\\\\\n    # Apply mapping\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(rows):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(cols):\\\\\\\\n            val = input_matrix[r, c]\\\\\\\\n            if val in color_map:\\\\\\\\n                output[r, c] = color_map[val]\\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
