    "user_explanation": "So the input-output dimensions are the same. That is 9x9 remains 9x9 or 8x7 remains 8x7. Also, there's a huge blue background in essence, 0 which exists and largely isn't modified. Then a brown cell exists, which is overlapped with a multi-color pattern. Now, how to detect this shape/pattern: find a non-brown non-blue color, then use BFS like basically any neighbor which is non-blue becomes part of pattern, then that searches its neighbors until exhausted. Finally, it kind of becomes some shape which is almost always 3x3 block, like the pattern doesn't encompass within the 3x3 but it falls within one. So find the lowest row, highest row, lowest col, highest col thus figuring out the pattern. Now, record the pattern and copy paste it over the brown cell detected, with that being the center. However, original pattern is also retained at its original location.

This pattern is made up of various colors (integers other than 0 or 5), such as green (2), orange (1), pink/purple (6), and red (3). The specific colors and arrangements vary per example.\\\\\\\\n- The pattern always consists of spatially connected non-blue, non-brown (i.e., value != 0, 5) cells. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Connected\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" means any two pattern cells share an edge (4-connectivity).\\\\\\\\n- The pattern is compactly placed, almost always forming a roughly rectangular or square (frequently 3x3 or similar) arrangement. No pattern crosses over itself or is disjoint. The boundary of the pattern exists within a reasonably small block.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpatial Relationships and Transformations:\\\\\\\\n- All cells not part of the blue background or the brown cell are part of this contiguous pattern.\\\\\\\\n- In the output, the brown cell is missing\\\\u2014it's replaced by blue (0).\\\\\\\\n- In the output, a copy of the pattern, identical in shape and color, is placed elsewhere in the grid.\\\\\\\\n- The original instance of the pattern is retained untouched in the output.\\\\\\\\n- The copied pattern is always placed such that its center aligns with the previous position of the brown cell (value 5). To determine the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"center\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the pattern: the smallest and largest row/column indices among pattern cells are used, and their midpoint (integer division) gives the center.\\\\\\\\n- When copying, pattern positions are shifted such that this central pattern coordinate overlays the brown cell, preserving relative arrangement.\\\\\\\\n- If copying the pattern causes some parts to extend outside the grid, those cells are not written (always check boundaries).\\\\\\\\n- Only the brown cell is replaced by blue (0), but the surroundings remain unchanged unless overlain by the copied pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetry/Exceptions:\\\\\\\\n- No reflections, rotations, or color changes are involved.\\\\\\\\n- The only repeated pattern is the pattern copy process and subsequent brown-cell erasure.\\\\\\\\n- Pattern size and shape can vary but are always contiguous and centered for copying.\\\\\\\\n- This process applies universally to each example.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 1 Summary\\\\u2014Key Invariants:\\\\\\\\n- Input/output sizes are unchanged.\\\\\\\\n- There is always a single brown cell and one contiguous pattern for copying.\\\\\\\\n- Blue background is preserved except for cells overwritten during pattern copying or the erased brown cell.\\\\\\\\n- Pattern copy is centered on brown's position; the original pattern stays in place.\\\\\\\\n- No change to the pattern itself; only position is shifted for copying.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving (detailed reasoning and algorithm)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 1: Copy Input to Output\\\\\\\\nStart by duplicating the entire input grid, ensuring all unchanged elements persist unless specifically overwritten later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2: Locate the Brown Cell\\\\\\\\n- Scan the grid to locate the brown cell (cell value 5).\\\\\\\\n- Record its coordinates (let's call it (brown_r, brown_c)).\\\\\\\\n- There is always exactly one, per our visual analysis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 3: Identify the Pattern\\\\\\\\n- The pattern consists of all cells whose value is neither 0 (background) nor 5 (brown cell).\\\\\\\\n- Since these cells must be contiguous, use BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) starting from any non-background, non-brown cell found in the grid.\\\\\\\\n- While traversing, mark visited cells to avoid revisiting and to ensure only the actual connected pattern is covered (in case of noise, but in all examples, there's exactly one clear pattern).\\\\\\\\n- For each traversed cell, record its location and its value. Store these as tuples: (row, col, value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 4: Calculate Pattern Bounds and Center\\\\\\\\n- Derive the minimal and maximal row and column index in the pattern (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).\\\\\\\\n- From these, the pattern's center coordinate is:\\\\\\\\n  - center_r = (min_row + max_row) // 2\\\\\\\\n  - center_c = (min_col + max_col) // 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 5: Compute Shifting Offset\\\\\\\\n- The objective is to overlay the pattern onto the position where the brown cell was, with the pattern's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"center\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" aligning perfectly with the brown cell location.\\\\\\\\n- The shift required:\\\\\\\\n  - row_offset = brown_r - center_r\\\\\\\\n  - col_offset = brown_c - center_c\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 6: Remove the Brown Cell\\\\\\\\n- Set the original brown cell's position in the output grid to 0, removing the brown marker.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 7: Overlay Pattern Centered on Brown Cell\\\\\\\\n- For every cell (pattern_r, pattern_c, value) in the pattern:\\\\\\\\n   - Compute new_r = pattern_r + row_offset\\\\\\\\n   - Compute new_c = pattern_c + col_offset\\\\\\\\n   - Only if new_r and new_c are within grid bounds, assign output_grid[new_r][new_c] = value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 8: Output the Result\\\\\\\\n- The resulting grid will show the original pattern (unchanged), the brown cell removed, and a new instance of the pattern centered at the brown cell's former location.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlgorithm Pseudocode:\\\\\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\\\\\nfrom collections import deque\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef transform(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_mat)\\\\\\\\n    # Step 2: Find the brown cell\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(input_mat.shape[0]):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(input_mat.shape[1]):\\\\\\\\n            if input_mat[r, c] == 5:\\\\\\\\n                brown_r, brown_c = r, c\\\\\\\\n    # Step 3: Find the pattern cells\\\\\\\\n    visited = set()\\\\\\\\n    pattern_cells = []\\\\\\\\n    found = False\\\\\\\\n    for r in range(input_mat.shape[0]):\\\\\\\\n        for c in range(input_mat.shape[1]):\\\\\\\\n            if input_mat[r, c] not in (0, 5):\\\\\\\\n                queue = deque([(r, c)])\\\\\\\\n                visited.add((r, c))\\\\\\\\n                while queue:\\\\\\\\n                    cr, cc = queue.popleft()\\\\\\\\n                    pattern_cells.append((cr, cc, input_mat[cr, cc]))\\\\\\\\n                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\\\\\\\\n                        nr, nc = cr+dr, cc+dc\\\\\\\\n                        if (0 <= nr < input_mat.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < input_mat.shape[1] and\\\\\\\\n                            (nr, nc) not in visited and input_mat[nr, nc] not in (0, 5)):\\\\\\\\n                            queue.append((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\\\\\\\\n                found = True\\\\\\\\n                break\\\\\\\\n        if found: break\\\\\\\\n    # Step 4: Pattern boundary and center\\\\\\\\n    min_row = min(cell[0] for cell in pattern_cells)\\\\\\\\n    max_row = max(cell[0] for cell in pattern_cells)\\\\\\\\n    min_col = min(cell[1] for cell in pattern_cells)\\\\\\\\n    max_col = max(cell[1] for cell in pattern_cells)\\\\\\\\n    center_r = (min_row + max_row) // 2\\\\\\\\n    center_c = (min_col + max_col) // 2\\\\\\\\n    # Step 6: Remove brown cell\\\\\\\\n    output_grid[brown_r, brown_c] = 0\\\\\\\\n    # Step 5: Offset for centering\\\\\\\\n    row_offset = brown_r - center_r\\\\\\\\n    col_offset = brown_c - center_c\\\\\\\\n    # Step 7: Overlay pattern\\\\\\\\n    for r0, c0, val in pattern_cells:\\\\\\\\n        nr, nc = r0 + row_offset, c0 + col_offset\\\\\\\\n        if 0 <= nr < input_mat.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < input_mat.shape[1]:\\\\\\\\n            output_grid[nr, nc] = val\\\\\\\\n    return output_grid\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting and Parameter Analysis:\\\\\\\\n- This approach is robust for any single brown-cell scenario and operates on arbitrary pattern shapes as long as connectivity holds.\\\\\\\\n- Handles edge cases such as the pattern touching grid boundaries, or the brown cell at/near an edge (may cause partial pattern placement).\\\\\\\\n- Pattern copy will not overwrite non-pattern, non-background cells unless overlapping by design (never observed in these examples).\\\\\\\\n- No global rotations/reflections;
