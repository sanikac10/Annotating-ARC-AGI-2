    "user_explanation": "So, all boxes are dimensions 5x5 input and same outputs 2x2 all of them which seem to be a sliced up matrix from the input. The idea is that, they consist of 4 separate 2x2 boxes on each corner: [0:2, 0:2], [0:2, 3:4], [3:4, 0:2], [3:4, 3:4] now each of these 4 blocks, has a simple odd one out. Compute MSE of the first one against the other three, if all of the other three have a non-zero MSE, then the first 2x2 is sliced out. If not, then whichever one is non-zero is extracted as the output.",

Grid Sizes and Structure:\\\\\\\\n- All input grids are of size 5x5 (square matrices).\\\\\\\\n- All output grids are of size 2x2 (smaller square matrices, visually suggest they are sub-blocks of the input).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Colors and Values:\\\\\\\\n- Input matrices have multiple color values: Example 1 uses 0 (blue) and 1 (orange), Example 2 uses 0 (blue) and 2 (green), Example 3 uses 0 (blue) and 5 (brown). The output grid uses only the color values present in inputs.\\\\\\\\n- There are always two unique values involved in each case (one representing a background, another representing a 'feature').\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Spatial Patterns and Arrangements:\\\\\\\\n- In every input, the arrangement suggests that the outer regions contain blocks of feature colors (either mostly in the corners or as patterned strips), with the center often serving as a divider or being less feature-dense (often having all-zero blocks).\\\\\\\\n- Visual grouping suggests input could be divided into four distinct 2x2 corner sub-grids (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) possibly excluding the center row and column.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Output-Input Relationship:\\\\\\\\n- The output matrix is always a 2x2 section that visually matches one of the four corners of the input matrix. In each example, it seems to extract precisely one of these corners without alteration.\\\\\\\\n- Which corner is chosen is not simply static (not always top-left or a fixed corner across examples).\\\\\\\\n- Comparing the chosen corner's content with others shows that three corners are visually similar or identical, and the selected (output) submatrix is distinctly different.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Pattern, Symmetry, and Repetition:\\\\\\\\n- In each input, at least three submatrices among the four corners appear identical or extremely similar, with one submatrix being visually different \\\\u2014 either in arrangement, coloring, or a single element.\\\\\\\\n- The odd corner is always the output.\\\\\\\\n- The transformation from input to output does not involve any rotation, flipping, or reflection \\\\u2014 it's a direct extract of a region.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. Conditional and Numerical Properties:\\\\\\\\n- Across all inputs, the comparison is made over 2x2 sub-blocks, focusing on which one stands out as different.\\\\\\\\n- The uniqueness of a submatrix is always in terms of element-wise mismatch (i.e., difference from the majority blocks), not because of location.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummary: The transformation extracts the only 2x2 corner block distinct from the other three, and this selection could be determined via a metric like MSE (mean squared error) or equivalent measure of submatrix similarity. Each 5x5 input is checked at its corners for the 2x2 blocks; the unique one is returned as output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep-by-Step Expanded Reasoning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Partition the 5x5 Input Matrix:\\\\\\\\n- Identify the four 2x2 corner blocks:\\\\\\\\n   - Top-left:      rows 0-1, columns 0-1 -> input_mat[0:2, 0:2]\\\\\\\\n   - Top-right:     rows 0-1, columns 3-4 -> input_mat[0:2, 3:5]\\\\\\\\n   - Bottom-left:   rows 3-4, columns 0-1 -> input_mat[3:5, 0:2]\\\\\\\\n   - Bottom-right:  rows 3-4, columns 3-4 -> input_mat[3:5, 3:5]\\\\\\\\n- Each block is a 2x2 matrix, labelled, e.g., blocks[0], blocks[1], blocks[2], blocks[3]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Compare Each Block Against Others:\\\\\\\\n- For each 2x2 block, compare it against the remaining three blocks to measure similarity. The most reliable way is to use an element-wise difference (e.g., mean squared error, or count of differing elements).\\\\\\\\n- For each block, compute the MSE or difference count compared with each of the other three. For example, for block[0], compare with block[1], block[2], block[3], and collect results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Determine the Odd Block:\\\\\\\\n- The 'odd' block is the one whose values are not matched by any of the other three \\\\u2014 i.e., the only block with a nonzero difference against all other blocks.\\\\\\\\n- In implementation, for each block, if difference with all others is nonzero (or above a certain threshold), that means it's unique, and that's the desired output.\\\\\\\\n- There will always be precisely one such block, as the problem guarantees exactly one odd one out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Output Construction:\\\\\\\\n- Once the unique block is identified, return this 2x2 block as the result. No reshaping, color change, or modification is needed\\\\u2014just extract and present.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudo-code:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef extract_odd_corner_block(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    # Step 1: Extract the four 2x2 corner blocks\\\\\\\\n    blocks = [\\\\\\\\n        input_mat[0:2, 0:2],      # top-left\\\\\\\\n        input_mat[0:2, 3:5],      # top-right\\\\\\\\n        input_mat[3:5, 0:2],      # bottom-left\\\\\\\\n        input_mat[3:5, 3:5]       # bottom-right\\\\\\\\n    ]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Step 2: Compare each block with the other three\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(4):\\\\\\\\n        count_different = 0\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(4):\\\\\\\\n            if i == j:\\\\\\\\n                continue\\\\\\\\n            if not np.array_equal(blocks[i], blocks[j]):  # Can also use MSE if necessary\\\\\\\\n                count_different += 1\\\\\\\\n        # Step 3: Find the block different from all others\\\\\\\\n        if count_different == 3:\\\\\\\\n            return blocks[i]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nValidation against Provided Examples:\\\\\\\\n- For each example, exactly one corner 2x2 block is distinct from the other three. The extraction rule above directly produces the provided outputs.\\\\\\\\n- No special adjustment needed for color values: the rule is based entirely on structural and value comparison among the four corners.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdge Cases and Generalization:\\\\\\\\n- If an input matrix contained more than four non-overlapping 2x2 blocks (e.g., larger grids), this logic would need extension to all such sub-blocks.\\\\\\\\n- If two corners were equally 'odd' (same differences), the output would be undefined \\\\u2014 but the problem ensures only one.\\\\\\\\n- All operations are spatially local to the corners and do not depend on global grid structure, so as long as the matrix is at least 4x4, the method is valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJustification:\\\\\\\\n- At each step, the block is chosen not by position, but by being the sole outlier. The mean squared error approach ensures robust difference calculations even if multiple color values are used in future problems.\\\\\\\\n- The solution is fully transparent; each transformation can be visually confirmed, and the chosen submatrix always matches the provided output.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Function to convert the input matrix to output matrix\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef convert(input_matrix):\\\\\\\\n    # Step 1: Extract the four 2x2 corner blocks\\\\\\\\n    blocks = [\\\\\\\\n        input_matrix[0:2, 0:2],      # top-left\\\\\\\\n        input_matrix[0:2, 3:5],      # top-right\\\\\\\\n        input_matrix[3:5, 0:2],      # bottom-left\\\\\\\\n        input_matrix[3:5, 3:5]       # bottom-right\\\\\\\\n    ]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Step 2: Compare each block with the other three\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(4):\\\\\\\\n        count_different = 0\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(4):\\\\\\\\n            if i == j:\\\\\\\\n                continue\\\\\\\\n            if not np.array_equal(blocks[i], blocks[j]):\\\\\\\\n                count_different += 1\\\\\\\\n        # Step 3: Find the block different from all others\\\\\\\\n        if count_different == 3:\\\\\\\\n            return blocks[i]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
