    "user_explanation": "Observe the matrix dimension changes between input and outputs. So (inputs are 4x2 they becomes 5x3 in output) or (inputs are 2x1 then it becomes 3x2 in outputs) that is increment by +1 in rows and +1 in columns. Then now what's filled in here? so first of any fill-in is with blue. But how does the fill in occur. So, observe each image, they form vertical pieces entirely which is split exactly in the middle. So, like (4x2) can be split into (2x2) and (2x2). Or like in example 2, it's (2x1) thus creating two blocks of (1x1) and (1x1). Or lets look at example 3, its (6x3) it should be split into blocks (3x3) and (3x3). Then now you went from input_matrix to input_mat_top_half and input_mat_bottom_half. Then you simply put a blue column at the end of input_mat_top_half, then blue row size of width+1. and then finally a blue starting column for input_mat_bottom_half. Thus incrementing width by 1 for both input_mat_top_half and input_mat_bottom_half and the number of rows also incremented by 1 with the middle blue row. Note there, no point of doing a midpoint of columns, this is only being vertically split. And yes say you've input_matrix, then num_rows = input_matrix.shape[0], then input_mat_top_half = input_matrix[:num_rows//2] and input_mat_bottom_half = ",

One color (bright blue, digit '9') appears only in the output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpatial Layout and Structural Changes:\\\\\\\\n- In each example, the input matrix is vertically split into two equally sized blocks (top half and bottom half):\\\\\\\\n  - If the number of input rows (n) is even, dividing n by 2 gives the split. Each block retains all columns.\\\\\\\\n  - The splitting is purely along the row direction; columns aren\\\\u2019t split.\\\\\\\\n- In the output grid:\\\\\\\\n  1. The top half of the input grid appears in the upper-left portion of the output grid.\\\\\\\\n  2. The bottom half of the input grid appears in the lower-right portion of the output grid, but shifted right and down by 1 (due to insertion of blue row and column).\\\\\\\\n- The \\\\u201cspace\\\\u201d between top and bottom halves (in the output) is filled with blue (value '9'). \\\\\\\\n  - This blue color always fills one newly inserted column to the right of the top half and one newly inserted row below the top half, forming a \\\\u2018L\\\\u2019-shaped separator in the center.\\\\\\\\n  - Any further overflow spaces (like the central cell if width and height increases overlap) also filled blue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetry and Consistency:\\\\\\\\n- The transformation is always symmetrical across the vertical division: top half preserves original columns, bottom half shifted. No content is rotated or flipped.\\\\\\\\n- The insertion of blue regions is strictly at the intersection of new row and new column, making output grid a block diagonal with blue separator between two otherwise unchanged blocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPattern Frequency and Exceptions:\\\\\\\\n- For all tested input sizes (even number of rows), split is always halfway. If rows are odd, would need to decide how the split occurs (not shown in these examples).\\\\\\\\n- No pattern for color changes or value swaps; everything except blue fillers are direct copies from input.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNumerical Properties:\\\\\\\\n- Output rows = input rows + 1\\\\\\\\n- Output columns = input columns + 1\\\\\\\\n- Top-half block is (input_rows//2) x input_cols, positioned at top-left\\\\\\\\n- Bottom-half block is (input_rows//2) x input_cols, positioned lower and further right by one row and one column each.\\\\\\\\n- Blue fillers: intersecting region, rest between blocks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConditional Rules:\\\\\\\\n- The operation is fully generic for any even-rowed input. No other conditional cases appear.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummary: The transformation involves vertical splitting of input, blue-fill separation, size increment by +1 row and +1 column, and precise placement of blocks. No aspect of the input other than vertical splitting drives the transformation, and blue-fill rules appear absolute and unambiguous.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"solving\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"PART 2: Solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep-by-Step Reasoning:\\\\\\\\n1. **Determine Dimensions and Split Point:**\\\\\\\\n   - Let input_mat be an array of shape (h, w). Compute:\\\\\\\\n     - new_h = h + 1\\\\\\\\n     - new_w = w + 1\\\\\\\\n     - split_row = h // 2\\\\\\\\n2. **Split Input into Two Blocks:**\\\\\\\\n   - input_mat_top_half = input_mat[:split_row, :]\\\\\\\\n   - input_mat_bottom_half = input_mat[split_row:, :]\\\\\\\\n3. **Initialize Output Array:**\\\\\\\\n   - Create output_mat of shape (new_h, new_w), filled with the blue color (value '9').\\\\\\\\n4. **Place Top Half:**\\\\\\\\n   - output_mat[0:split_row, 0:w] = input_mat_top_half\\\\\\\\n   - The top half occupies the upper left, filling the first split_row rows and first w columns.\\\\\\\\n5. **Place Bottom Half:**\\\\\\\\n   - output_mat[split_row+1:new_h, 1:new_w] = input_mat_bottom_half\\\\\\\\n   - The bottom half is inserted starting from row split_row+1, and column 1 (shifted right and down due to blue separator).\\\\\\\\n6. **Blue Separator:**\\\\\\\\n   - The central row (index split_row) and the last column (index w) in the top half, and the first column (index 0) and all rows of the bottom half, remain blue (already initialized).\\\\\\\\n7. **Return Output Matrix:**\\\\\\\\n   - The result is output_mat, correctly formatted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPseudo-code:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\ndef arc_split_and_expand(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n    h, w = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    blue = 9\\\\\\\\n    new_h, new_w = h+1, w+1\\\\\\\\n    split_row = h//2\\\\\\\\n    output = np.full((new_h, new_w), blue, dtype=input_mat.dtype)\\\\\\\\n    # Place top half\\\\\\\\n    output[0:split_row, 0:w] = input_mat[:split_row, :]\\\\\\\\n    # Place bottom half\\\\\\\\n    output[split_row+1:new_h, 1:new_w] = input_mat[split_row:, :]\\\\\\\\n    return output\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting Against Examples:\\\\\\\\n- **Example 1 (4x2 \\\\u2192 5x3):**\\\\\\\\n  - Top half: input[0:2,:] to output[0:2,0:2]\\\\\\\\n  - Bottom half: input[2:4,:] to output[3:5,1:3]\\\\\\\\n  - Output is a 5x3 grid, blue column and row at the separator positions, as observed.\\\\\\\\n- **Example 2 (2x1 \\\\u2192 3x2):**\\\\\\\\n  - Top half: input[0:1,:] to output[0:1,0:1]\\\\\\\\n  - Bottom half: input[1:2,:] to output[2:3,1:2]\\\\\\\\n  - Rest filled blue.\\\\\\\\n- **Test (4x5 \\\\u2192 5x6):**\\\\\\\\n  - Top half: input[0:2,:] to output[0:2,0:5]\\\\\\\\n  - Bottom half: input[2:4,:] to output[3:5,1:6]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdge Cases and Generalizations:\\\\\\\\n- Inputs with odd numbers of rows: split_row = h//2 truncates down; may need to define if middle row stays with top or bottom (examples only use even rows).\\\\\\\\n- Works for any integer values/colors, as blue (9) is not expected in input.\\\\\\\\n- Transformation assumes input height >=2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReferences to Visuals:\\\\\\\\n- All placements and blue-fill regions correspond exactly to the arrangement and colors observed in the visual examples, with predictable separation and shifting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis detailed breakdown ensures every transformation phase is fully specified, traceable, and machine-interpretable.\\\\\\\"}\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"def convert(input_mat):\\\\\\\\n    import numpy as np\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    h, w = input_mat.shape\\\\\\\\n    blue = 9\\\\\\\\n    new_h, new_w = h + 1, w + 1\\\\\\\\n    split_row = h // 2\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Initialize output matrix filled with blue\\\\\\\\n    output_mat = np.full((new_h, new_w), blue, dtype=input_mat.dtype)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Place the top half\\\\\\\\n    output_mat[0:split_row, 0:w] = input_mat[:split_row, :]\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Place the bottom half\\\\\\\\n    output_mat[split_row + 1:new_h, 1:new_w] = input_mat[split_row:, :]\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    return output_mat\\\\\\\"}\\\"\"\n]",
